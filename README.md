# Earthquake Analysis Project

This project analyzes earthquake data and visualizes various aspects of the data using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure

- `all_month.csv`: The dataset containing earthquake data.
- `earthquake.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.

## Analysis

The notebook performs the following analyses:

- Reads and cleans the earthquake data.
- Filters earthquakes with magnitude greater than or equal to 5.
- Extracts and processes the location data.
- Groups and counts earthquakes by location.
- Visualizes the data using various plots.

## Visualizations

The notebook generates the following visualizations:

- Histogram of earthquake magnitudes.
- Scatter plot of earthquake locations.
- Bar plot of earthquake counts by location.
- Scatter plot of depth vs. magnitude.
